## Playing War Game
	1. The deck is split in half among two players, (it can be played multi player as well but for UI purposes we built it for two)
	2. The person who wins all the cards in the deck is declared winner, i.e. the object of the game is to collect the whole deck.
	3. When you press play game/draw card, you will draw a card that instantly appears on the table along with the computers card.
	4. The winner (the player who plays the card with the highest value) will take both of the cards on the table and add it to the bottom of their deck
	5. In the event of two cards of equal value are played, war is declared! each player puts 3 cards face down and then flips over a fourth. The player who plays the higher card out of those last two played, will take the entire pile on the table and add it to the bottom of their deck.
